Part D

a. 

4:3


b.

320 x 240


c. 

Horizontal: atan(320 / 2 / 336) = 0.44 rad = 25.5 deg

Vertical:	atan(240 / 2 / 336) = 0.34 rad = 19.7 deg


d.

distcoeff = [k_1, k_2, p_1, p_2, k_3]

Radial distortion:

k_1 (2nd order), k_2 (4th order), k_3 (6th order)

Tangential distortion:

p_1 (on x), p_2 (on y)

It seems that my camera has mild radial distortion and little 
tangential distortion.
